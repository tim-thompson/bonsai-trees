# bonsai-trees

Bonsai Trees is an example of a CRUD API Microservice written in Python using the Flask microframework. It is designed to be deployed on AWS Lambda using a SQL database for storage and Cognito User Pools for authentication.

This version of the API is an early version with complete functionality and tests intended to be used for further development towards a full SaaS product. It does not represent the final form of this API but does provide an example of what I think is a good way to work with simple microservices using Flask and Python.
